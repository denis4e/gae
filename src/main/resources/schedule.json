                "description": "Many data structures require a representation, where one parent node can have any arbitrary number of children. Inside relational databases, this typically is represented by a foreign key onto its own table. In Django\u2019s ORM, we use ``models.ForeignKey('self', ...)``, to create this kind of recursive relationship.\r\nThe major problem with this kind of representation is, that it doesn\u2019t scale for deep trees. Whenever we have to traverse the tree from a given starting node, our code has to perform one database query per hierarchy level.\r\nTo circumvent this, some database vendors implemented SQL dialects, to fetch a whole subtree with one query. Long time ago, Oracle for instance implemented 'CONNECT BY', which is proprietary and not part of the SQL standard. Nowadays, newer releases of most major database vendors implemented the 'WITH RECURSIVE' clause, which has been added to the SQL-99 standard. This allows us to build recursive queries.\r\n\r\nFortunately there is a clever recipe to represent hierarchies in relational databases using standard SQL techniques, but without the mentioned scaling problem: Materialized Path Trees, discovered by Vadim Tropashko. Django\u2019s ecosystem offers two libraries, which implement this design pattern: **django-mptt** and **django-treebeard**. I also would like to mention **django-tree**, which only works on Postgres, using their SQL extension mentioned before.\r\nIn this talk I\u2019ll explain the design patterns for Materialized Path Trees. Furthermore I\u2019ll show the pros and cons of both libraries.",

Creating APIs that other developers will love to use is a much harder problem.\r\nYou'll need to think about solving variety of topics such as versioning, authentication, response structure, documentation and more. There are existing good practices for each of them, but often developers who haven't done a lot of API work aren't familiar with them.\r\n\r\nMy talk will show how to build on top of Django and DRF and find reasonable solutions for those problems.\r\nI will talk about JSON API, OAuth2, and other technologies and show how they fit into the puzzle.\r\nBenefits of standardized response structure, as well as auto-generated documentation will also be discussed.\r\n\r\nI'll introduce OAuth2, discussing when it is a good choice and when not, as well as some trickier parts of it.\r\nNext we'll look at why a standardized response structure such as JSON API makes lives of 3rd-party developers easier.

There are various laws that factor into the amount of web accessibility a country must have, and the consequences a business can face because of that. Accessible web development also tends to lead to better UX and a happier user base. And, another plus: It will save devs time and frustration when they\u2019re working with the code, since good HTML is enforced.\r\n\r\nThis talk will start with a broad introduction to accessibility, how to break different concerns down into categories for consideration, and touch on some laws around web accessibility. The second part will go through examples of good and bad accessibility and what to look out for, as well as ways to improve accessibility (including \"easy wins\" that they could implement quickly to drastically improve their sites). The final section will include resources for finding accessibility standards and also browser extensions and the like for people to check on their own.\r\n\r\nThe audience will be expected to have working knowledge of the internet, webpages, and using webpages.",
